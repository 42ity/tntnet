REST demo
=========

This demo implements a simple rest interface. It has a in memory key value
store.

A REST interface uses the HTTP method to specify, what to do. With tntnet there
are mappings, which routes requests based on the HTTP method to specific
components. So the components itself do not need to interpret the method.

After compliation of the demo there 4 processes:

* rest: This is the server, which implements the server side interface

* putdata: A command line tool, which sends key value pairs to the server.

* getdata: A command line tool, which reads values from the server.

* deldata: A command line tool, which deletes key value pairs from the server.

Requests
--------

Get put a value; value in body
    method PUT url /key

Get the value
    method GET url /key

Delete the value
    method DELETE url /key

Get all keys
    method GET url /

Working with the command line tools
-----------------------------------

The easies way to understand the tools is to show examples. Run the server using
`./rest` in one terminal. Open another terminal and run the command line tools
there.

### Store 2 values in the server

    ./putdata key1 value1
    ./putdata key2 value2

### Read a value from the server

    ./getdata key1

This prints the value _value1_ to the terminal.

### Read the currently stored keys from the server

    ./getdata -a

This prints the keys _key1_ and _key2_ to the terminal.

### Delete one key

    ./deldata key2

This deletes the key _key2_ from the server. Verify it using `./getdata -a`.
