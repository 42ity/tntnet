Tntnet is a webapplicationserver for webapplications written in C++.

You can write a Web-page with HTML and with special tags you embed C++-code
into the page for active contents. These pages, called components are compiled
into C++-classes with the ecpp-compilier "ecppc", then compiled into
objectcode and linked into a shared library. This shared library is loaded
by the webserver "tntnet" on request and executed.

The ecpp-compiler can create also C++-classes from static files of any type,
e. g. you can compile a jpeg-image into the library. So the complete
webapplication is a single library.

The application runs native, so they are very fast and compact.

Installation
============

To install tntnet, you need some libraries, which are normally not installed
by default. These are:

boost_regex - the regular-expression library of boost (http://www.boost.org)
log4cplus - a logging-library (http://sourceforge.net/projects/log4cplus)
cxxtools - my own collection of C++-utilities (http://www.tntnet.org)

The build-system is created with autoconf/automake. Further informations you
can find in the file "INSTALL".
