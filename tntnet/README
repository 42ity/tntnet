Tntnet
======

Tntnet is a webapplicationserver for webapplications written in C++.

You can write a Web-page with HTML and with special tags you embed
C++-code into the page for active contents. These pages, called
components are compiled into C++-classes with the ecpp-compilier
"ecppc", then compiled into objectcode and linked into a shared library.
This shared library is loaded by the webserver "tntnet" on request and
executed.

The ecpp-compiler can create also C++-classes from static files of any
type, e. g. you can compile a jpeg-image into the library. So the
complete webapplication is a single library.

The application runs native, so they are very fast and compact.

Installation 
============

To install tntnet, you need some libraries, which are normally not
installed by default. These are:

boost_regex - the regular-expression library of boost (http://www.boost.org)
cxxtools - my own collection of C++-utilities (http://www.tntnet.org)

this version needs cxxtools version >=1.3.0.


Installation from CVS 
=====================

In the CVS-repository there is no configure-script, but configure.in,
which is the source for configure. You need autoconf and automake to
create configure.  There is a shellscript autogen.sh included, which
calls the desired programs.

I used automake 1.9.4 and autoconf 2.5.9 for development.
