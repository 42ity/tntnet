Tntnet
======

Tntnet is a webapplicationserver for webapplications written in C++.

You can write a Web-page with HTML and with special tags you embed
C++-code into the page for active contents. These pages, called
components are compiled into C++-classes with the ecpp-compilier
"ecppc", then compiled into objectcode and linked into a shared library.
This shared library is loaded by the webserver "tntnet" on request and
executed.

The ecpp-compiler can create also C++-classes from static files of any
type, e.g. you can compile a jpeg-image into the library. So the
whole webapplication is a single library.

The application runs native, so they are very fast and compact.

Features supported include: cookies, HTTP-upload, automatic request-parameter
parsing and conversion, automatic sessionmanagement, scoped variables
(application, request and session), internationalisation, keep-alive.

Logging is done through cxxtools, which provides a unique API for log4cpp,
log4cxx or simple logging to files or console.

Tntnet is fully multithreaded and much work has been gone into making it
scalable. It uses a dynamic pool of workerthreads, which answers requests
from http-clients.

Ssl is supported via the openssl-library.

Installation 
============

To install tntnet, you need cxxtools (http://www.tntnet.org/).

this version needs cxxtools version >=1.3.0.

you can find generig installation instructions in the file INSTALL.

After building you can try out tntnet by changing to a directory of a
demo-application (e.g. cd sdk/demos/session) and running
"../../../framework/runtime/tntnet -c tntnet.conf". Start your browser and
navigate to "http://localhost:8000/session" (or whatever demo you choosed) and
watch the result.

Quick start
===========

To create a simple application run "tntnet-config --project=hello".
This creates a directory "hello" with a simple project and prints
out a short message, how to run the application.

There are some demo-applications you can try out and play with in sdk/demos.

Documentation is provided in OpenOffice- or pdf-formats in doc/tntnet.* and doc/tntnet-configuration.*.
