  - Simplified constant data-handling for i18n

2005-11-04 tommi@tntnet.org

    minutes), the thread is considered hanging and tntnet is restarted
    automatically.

  - delay initialization of logging after changing user and group. This ensures
    that logfiles are created with the right permissions.
  - increase defaults for MinThreads from 5 to 10 and MaxThreads from 10 to 100.
    Threads are not that expensive and it should not hurt to create much more.

2005-09-26 tommi@tntnet.org

  - components are created with a factory instead of a create-method.
	This way there is no need to convert a void* to a function-pointer, what
	is not defined in c++.
