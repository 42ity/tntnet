2007-03-25 tommi@tntnet.org
  - use TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT if available

    which removes on context-switch on each accepted connection

    minutes), the thread is considered hanging and tntnet is restarted
    automatically.

  - delay initialization of logging after changing user and group. This ensures
    that logfiles are created with the right permissions.
  - increase defaults for MinThreads from 5 to 10 and MaxThreads from 10 to 100.
