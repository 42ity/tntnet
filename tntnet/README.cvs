Installation from CVS 
=====================

In the CVS-repository there is no configure-script, but configure.in,
which is the source for configure. You need autoconf and automake to
create configure.  There is a shellscript autogen.sh included, which
calls the desired programs.

I used automake 1.9.4 and autoconf 2.5.9 for development.
