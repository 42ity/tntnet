To build on AIX a link flag -qmkshrobj is needed for shared libraries.
To do that, you need to add that flag to the Makefiles, which create shared
libraries after configure.

The files to edit are:
    framework/common/Makefile
    sdk/tools/common/Makefile

Look for a line, which starts with "LDFLAGS=" and append the mentioned flag
"-qmkshrobj" to that line.
