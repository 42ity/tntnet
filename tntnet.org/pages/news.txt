        <h3>2007-12-16, New stable versions, cxxtools 1.4.6, tntnet 1.6.1, tntdb 0.9.5</h3>
        <p>The features released in the development releases are considered stable
        now.</p>

        <p>Cxxtools have got some feature enhancements like support for signal-slot
        and wrappers for atomic functions. Locking in logger-classes is reduced, so
        that threads do not need to wait for other threads when logging. Logging may be
        passed to a subprocess, which can run under a different user, when the main
        process starts as root.</p>

        <p>Tntdb has support for blobs. And this time the archive is complete. The
        0.9.4 release lacked some important files, so if you had problems with that it
        was purely my fault ;-).</p>

        <p>The main enhancement in tntnet was the move of most of the tntnet-code into
        the library, so it is easy to use tntnet in applications. Also a wrapper for
        fork was added, since it is somewhat dangerous to start subprocesses without
        that, since subprocesses will block restarts, since they inherit listener
        ports. To fork subprocesses in tntnet-applications use this:
        </p>

        <pre>
        if (request.getApplication().forkProcess())
        {
            // here we are in child process
            exit(0);  // this or exec... is mandatory!!!
        }
        </pre>
        <br/>

        <h3>2007-11-17, New development version of tntnet 1.6.0.6</h3>

        <p>After some small fixes tntnet compiles with the Sun Studio compiler.
        A chapter about stand alone webapplications with tntnet was added into the
        documentation. After changing fonts in the documents, filesizes got much
        smaller.</p>
        <br/>

        <h3>2007-11-16, New development versions of cxxtools 1.4.5.3</h3>

        <p>This adds functions for handling endianess and wrappers for fast atomic
        operations for various processors.</p>
        <br/>

        <h3>2007-10-21, new development versions of cxxtools 1.4.5.1 and tntnet 1.6.0.4</h3>

        <p>Cxxtools gets a fast template based signal-slot implementation from Marc.
        Libltdl is replaced by a simple dlopen-wrapper. The smart pointer gets an
        additional destroy policy.</p>
