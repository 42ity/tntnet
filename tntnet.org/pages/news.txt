<p>Cxxtools has make a quantum leap forward to a general purpose C++ library.
This version adds a fast template based signal slot framework, a serialization
system, asyncronous I/O with iostreams, a http server and a improved http
client, XML reader and writer, and a great XMLRCP client and server.
</p>

<p>Tntnet and Tntdb has got some minor bug fixes and are adjusted to the API
changes in cxxtools (which are quite small).

<p>These versions mainly fix some bugs found in the last weeks.<p>

<p>The regex-wrapper classes from tntnet are now copied to cxxtools and are
fully functional now. Cxxtools also got a set of conversion functions as easy
to use wrappers around std::stringstream. The so-number is increased to
indicate binary incompatiblity to older versions (at least <= 1.4.6)</p>

<p>Clearing cookies was broken since about a year. This is fixed now. Quotes
and double quotes in c++ comments in ecpp files was not handled correctly.
Initialization of scoped variables may expand to multiple lines now (this was
actually intended behaviour before, but incorrectly implemented). Here also the
so-number was increased.</p>

<p>The sqlite-driver of tntdb had 2 small bugs. Setting strings in statements
did not lead to equality when compared to columns. Using multiple cursors for
one statement crashed tntdb when the cursors were released in reverse order.

<p>The features released in the development releases are considered stable
now.</p>

<p>Cxxtools have got some feature enhancements like support for signal-slot
and wrappers for atomic functions. Locking in logger-classes is reduced, so
that threads do not need to wait for other threads when logging. Logging may be
passed to a subprocess, which can run under a different user, when the main
process starts as root.</p>

<p>Tntdb has support for blobs. And this time the archive is complete. The
0.9.4 release lacked some important files, so if you had problems with that it
was purely my fault ;-).</p>

<p>The main enhancement in tntnet was the move of most of the tntnet-code into
the library, so it is easy to use tntnet in applications. Also a wrapper for
fork was added, since it is somewhat dangerous to start subprocesses without
that, since subprocesses will block restarts, since they inherit listener
ports. To fork subprocesses in tntnet-applications use this:
</p>

<pre>
  if (request.getApplication().forkProcess())
  {
    // here we are in child process
    exit(0);  // this or exec... is mandatory!!!
  }
</pre>

<p>A policy-based smart-pointer-class is included here. I have used this implementation
in tntdb for some time and copied it to many projects since then. Therefore I decided
to finally include it into my toolbox. The default policy is intrusive reference counted,
which is the safest model. The objects held need to have methods "addRef" and "release".
This is easily done by using cxxtools::RefCounted as a (additional?) base-class.</p>

<p>I have rewritten the parser for ini-files. The new parser is much cleaner. The
parser is separated from the data-structure, which makes it possible to use the
parser separately. The interface to the class has changed heavily, so you need to
port your application to the new class, if you have used this part of cxxtools.</p>

<p>I also wrote a parser for property-files, which are quite popular in the java-world.
They have the advantage to support hieracial structures, while beeing still easily
readable and writable.</p>

characters, which are printed. The rolling-file-appender uses it to monitor filesize,
which make flushdelay to work with it.

<p>In Tntdb 0.6.2 the mysql-driver got some bugfixes. Fetching some datatypes (e.g. timestamp)
resulted in a crash, because the Mysql-API returns too small lengths (or I misunderstand
the API;-) ).

<p>Tntnet extends the license to allow linking with openssl. Some ANSI-C++-violations
are fixed. A new demo newsdb is added, which demonstrates, how to access a database with
Tntdb from a web application. The documentation was reformatted to use only standard fonts,
which reduces the size of the tarball.

 I finally declared Tntnet 1.5.0 and cxxtools 1.4.0 as stable, just because
 they are. Tntnet 1.5.0 is faster than ever and has gone through many
 stability- and speed-tests, which makes it rock-solid and incredibly fast.
</p>

<p>
 Cxxtools got a new logging-feature, which speeds up logging quite
 significantly. The parameter "flushdelay" enables a background-thread,
 which flushes the outputfile asynchronously. The logentries don't trigger
 a flush, so may logentries are written with one system-call.
 This results in a 15% speed-up of Tntnet in simple cases. Without it
 dynamic pages are just as fast as static pages in apache2. With
 delayed flush Tntnet is well ahead of apache2.

<p>
Removed boost dependency. Tntnet uses now the POSIX.2-regex instead of
boost-regex. This greatly simplifies installation and also reduces
binary-size. Also a memory-leak in 1.4.0pre1 was fixed.
</p>

<p>
There is a users-guide (in open-office-format) and a yet unfinished
configuration-guide.
</p>

<p>
I tested this release successfully with gcc-4.0.1, which greatly improves
performance (about 20% faster compared to 3.3.4).

cxxtools-config is a configuration-script, to help compile against cxxtools
