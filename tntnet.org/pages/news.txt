                The features released in the development releases are considered stable
                now.
        
                Cxxtools have got some feature enhancements like support for signal-slot
                and wrappers for atomic functions. Locking in logger-classes is reduced, so
                that threads do not need to wait for other threads when logging. Logging may be
                passed to a subprocess, which can run under a different user, when the main
                process starts as root.
        
                Tntdb has support for blobs. And this time the archive is complete. The
                0.9.4 release lacked some important files, so if you had problems with that it
                was purely my fault ;-).
        
                The main enhancement in tntnet was the move of most of the tntnet-code into
                the library, so it is easy to use tntnet in applications. Also a wrapper for
                fork was added, since it is somewhat dangerous to start subprocesses without
                that, since subprocesses will block restarts, since they inherit listener
                ports. To fork subprocesses in tntnet-applications use this:
        
                <pre>
    if (request.getApplication().forkProcess())
    {
        // here we are in child process
        exit(0);  // this or exec... is mandatory!!!
    }
                </pre>

                After some small fixes tntnet compiles with the Sun Studio compiler.
                A chapter about stand alone webapplications with tntnet was added into the
                documentation. After changing fonts in the documents, filesizes got much
                smaller.
