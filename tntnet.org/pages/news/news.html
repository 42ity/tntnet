<h2>development versions cxxtools 1.99.4, tntnet 1.6.99 and tntdb 1.0.99</h2>

<p>2009-06-13</p>

<p>Cxxtools has make a quantum leap forward to a general purpose C++ library.
This version adds a fast template based signal slot framework, a serialization
system, asyncronous I/O with iostreams, a http server and a improved http
client, XML reader and writer, and a great XMLRCP client and server.
</p>

<p>Tntnet and Tntdb has got some minor bug fixes and are adjusted to the API
changes in cxxtools (which are quite small).
</p>

<h2>stable versions cxxtools 1.4.8, tntnet 1.6.3 and tntdb 1.0.1</h2>

<p>2008-06-03</p>

<p>These versions mainly fix some bugs found in the last weeks.<p>

<p>The regex-wrapper classes from tntnet are now copied to cxxtools and are
fully functional now. Cxxtools also got a set of conversion functions as easy
to use wrappers around std::stringstream. The so-number is increased to
indicate binary incompatiblity to older versions (at least <= 1.4.6)</p>

<p>Clearing cookies was broken since about a year. This is fixed now. Quotes
and double quotes in c++ comments in ecpp files was not handled correctly.
Initialization of scoped variables may expand to multiple lines now (this was
actually intended behaviour before, but incorrectly implemented). Here also the
so-number was increased.</p>

<p>The sqlite-driver of tntdb had 2 small bugs. Setting strings in statements
did not lead to equality when compared to columns. Using multiple cursors for
one statement crashed tntdb when the cursors were released in reverse order.
</p>

<h2>stable version tntnet 1.6.2</h2>

<p>2008-04-20</p>

<p>A shutdown bug is fixed. And all the small fixes from the development
branch is released here in the stable version. The major ones are the fixes
of GnuTLS and http-auth.

<h2>development version tntnet 1.6.1.3</h2>

<p>2008-04-04</p>

<p>This version brings some bugfixes. GnuTLS-support is much more robust and
also faster now. OpenSsl supports certificate chains. Http-Auth does not cache
usernames and passwords in keep-alive requests any more.</p>

<h2>stable version tntdb 1.0.0</h2>

<p>2008-02-24</p>

<p><a href="tntdb.hms">Tntdb</a> has reached version 1.0.0. That means, that tntdb does not have
any known bugs and the API as well as the ABI will be kept as stable as
possible.</p>

<h2>new stable versions, cxxtools 1.4.6, tntnet 1.6.1, tntdb 0.9.5</h2>

<p>2007-12-16</p>

<p>The features released in the development releases are considered stable
now.</p>

<p>Cxxtools have got some feature enhancements like support for signal-slot
and wrappers for atomic functions. Locking in logger-classes is reduced, so
that threads do not need to wait for other threads when logging. Logging may be
passed to a subprocess, which can run under a different user, when the main
process starts as root.</p>

<p>Tntdb has support for blobs. And this time the archive is complete. The
0.9.4 release lacked some important files, so if you had problems with that it
was purely my fault ;-).</p>

<p>The main enhancement in tntnet was the move of most of the tntnet-code into
the library, so it is easy to use tntnet in applications. Also a wrapper for
fork was added, since it is somewhat dangerous to start subprocesses without
that, since subprocesses will block restarts, since they inherit listener
ports. To fork subprocesses in tntnet-applications use this:
</p>

<pre>
  if (request.getApplication().forkProcess())
  {
    // here we are in child process
    exit(0);  // this or exec... is mandatory!!!
  }
</pre>

<h2>new development version of tntnet 1.6.0.6</h2>

<p>2007-11-17</p>

<p>After some small fixes tntnet compiles with the Sun Studio compiler.
A chapter about stand alone webapplications with tntnet was added into the
documentation. After changing fonts in the documents, filesizes got much
smaller.</p>

<h2>new development versions of cxxtools 1.4.5.3</h2>

<p>2007-11-16</p>

<p>This adds functions for handling endianess and wrappers for fast atomic
operations for various processors.</p>

<h2>new development versions of cxxtools 1.4.5.1 and tntnet 1.6.0.4</h2>

<p>2007-10-21</p>

<p>Cxxtools gets a fast template based signal-slot implementation from Marc.
Libltdl is replaced by a simple dlopen-wrapper. The smart pointer gets an
additional destroy policy.</p>

<p>Most of the code of tntnet is moved to libtntnet to make it possible to
embed tntnet in applications.</p>

<h2>tntdb updated to 0.6.4</h2>

<p>2007-10-06</p>

<p>Tntdb has got a driver for oracle. Now it supports sqlite, mysql, postgresql
and oracle. The driver is not compiled by default, but must be activated by
passing --with-oracle to the configure-script.
</p>

<p>Another fine update is support for decimals (thank you Mark Write).</p>

<p>And for those of you, who misses tntdb 0.6.3: I once packed a 0.6.3, but I
discovered some bugs before announcement, so I decided just to skip it.</p>

<h2>new develpment version 1.6.0.3 of tntnet</h2>

<p>2007-08-28</p>

<p>This version adds a parameter-scope to components, which receives named
parameters of any type when called. Also the generated class gets a prefix, so
that reserved words like "template" are now allowed for component names.</p>

<h2>new develpment version 1.6.0.2 of tntnet</h2>

<p>2007-07-13</p>

<p>In this version the locale can be set in components with SET_LANG
(e.g. SET_LANG("de_DE") ). Http-classes are restructured.
HttpReply::notAuthorized and HttpReply::redirect throw exceptions to make it
easy to call them in subcomponents.</p>

<h2>new version 1.4.5 of cxxtools</h2>

<p>2007-07-09</p>

<p>A policy-based smart-pointer-class is included here. I have used this implementation
in tntdb for some time and copied it to many projects since then. Therefore I decided
to finally include it into my toolbox. The default policy is intrusive reference counted,
which is the safest model. The objects held need to have methods "addRef" and "release".
This is easily done by using cxxtools::RefCounted as a (additional?) base-class.</p>

<p>I have rewritten the parser for ini-files. The new parser is much cleaner. The
parser is separated from the data-structure, which makes it possible to use the
parser separately. The interface to the class has changed heavily, so you need to
port your application to the new class, if you have used this part of cxxtools.</p>

<p>I also wrote a parser for property-files, which are quite popular in the java-world.
They have the advantage to support hieracial structures, while beeing still easily
readable and writable.</p>

<h2>development version tntnet 1.6.0.1</h2>

<p>2007-07-01</p>

<p>
This version adds support for HTTP basic authetication. A new tag &lt;%doc&gt; for block-comments in templates is added. Tntnet uses now standard locale instead of failing to run, if locale passed in LANG is invalid. Sessions are now valid in all urls instead of being url-specific. This was actually a bug, because it was intended initially the way, it is now.
</p>

<h2>stable version 1.6.0 of Tntnet, version 1.4.4 of cxxtools</h2>

<p>2007-05-28</p>

<p>
Here is the most stable version of Tntnet. Since Tntnet has matured since
1.5.3 more than ever before, I decided to take a jump in the version-number.
Thank you for the users, which greatly has helped me finding bugs and giving
feedback for improvements.
</p>

<h2>development version tntnet 1.5.3.7</h2>

<p>2007-05-24</p>

<p>
I decided to take another round before stable version. Tntnet has got some
bugfixes in mime-type-detection. Also a minor protocol-bug when sending static
pages is fixed.
</p>

<h2>development versions cxxtools 1.4.3.6, tntnet 1.5.3.6 and tntdb 0.9.2</h2>

<p>2007-05-12</p>

<p>
Tntnet, cxxtools and tntdb has got a wider user-base in the last months and
the result is a wealth of bugreports and suggestions to improve things. This
is the result of it. They are something like release-candidates, since I plan
to release new stable versions soon.
</p>

<h2>cooperation with FreeWRT</h2>

<p>2007-05-12</p>

<p>
We have started a cooperation with <a href="http://www.freewrt.org/">FreeWRT</a> to
port Tntnet to this nice embedded platform. This will show, how embedded systems with
less powerful CPUs will profit from the low cpu-usage of Tntnet. We will be at
<a href="http://www.linuxtag.de/2007/">Linuxtag</a> in Berlin from May 30th to June 2nd 2007
to show some results of our efforts. A presentation on June 2nd is also planned.
</p>

<h2>development versions cxxtools 1.4.3.5 and tntnet 1.5.3.4</h2>

<p>2007-04-18</p>

<p>
Some serious bugs were fixed, wich resulted in a crash or hang in tntnet under high load. Some code-adjustements has been made to compile both with for Sun Studio under Solaris.
</p>

<h2>development version 1.5.3.3 of tntnet</h2>

<p>2007-03-29</p>

<p>
License is changed from GPL to LGPL, which allows creation of closed source webapplications. Poll is replaced with epoll on platforms where available, which improves performance significantly on boxes with high load. Urls are now decoded. Listener-threads are removed, which removes a context-switch when new connections arrive. A racing-condition is fixed, which caused tntnet to segfault on MP-boxes under high load.
</p>

<h2>development version 1.4.3.4 of cxxtools</h2>

<p>2007-03-25</p>

<p>
Improve Pool-class: replace semaphore with condition and make maximum size
settable.
</p>

<h2>development version 1.4.3.3 of cxxtools</h2>

<p>2007-02-21</p>

<p>
fix bug in cxxtools::net::Stream: partial write from os was reported as eof instead of polling socket.
</p>

<h2>development version 1.5.3.2 of tntnet</h2>

<p>2007-01-26</p>

<p>
A redesign of the main-application-class is the major part of this release.
Process-handling is now in a separate class and uses the new fork(2)- and pipe(2)-wrappers
of cxxtools 1.4.3.2.
</p>

<h2>development version 1.4.3.2 of cxxtools</h2>

<p>2007-01-25</p>

<p>
I was active this time. New small bugfixes and new features were added. These are:
<ul>
 <li>new wrappers for fork(2) and pipe(2)</li>
 <li>cxxtools::Pipestream: a std::iostream using pipe(2) (look at demo/pipestream.cpp for useage for these 3 features</li>
 <li>support for udp-broadcast</li>
 <li>offset is settable in cxxtools::Hdostream</li>
 <li>cxxtools::Condition::timedwait</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>development version 1.5.3.1 of tntnet</h2>

<p>2007-01-10</p>

<p>
I've done some tweaks and enhancements in Tntnet, which improoves usability as well as performance.
The most major improvements are:
<ul>
 <li>VMapUrl for virtual host specific url-mapping</li>
 <li>use epoll instead of poll when available, which improves scalability</li>
 <li>option "-I dir" to specify include-directory for ecppc</li>
 <li>building of sdk and demos can be supressed, when building tntnet</li>
 <li>remove global factory-symbol, which removes naming-conflicts in different shared libraries</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>development version 1.4.3.1 of cxxtools</h2>

<p>2006-12-06</p>

<p>
This releases some minor fixes, I have fixed last months.
</p>

<h2>Release version 1.5.3 of tntnet</h2>

<p>2006-09-23</p>

<p>
Major bug-fix to 1.5.2: POST-requests did not work at all in the default
configuration.
</p>

<h2>Release version 0.9.0 of tntdb</h2>

<p>2006-09-15</p>

<p>
The jump in the version number indicates, that tntdb has proven
to be stable. License changed to LGPL, so that it is usable in
close-source applications. Compared to the previous version only
some minor bugfixes has happened.
</p>

<h2>Release version 1.5.2 of tntnet</h2>

<p>2006-09-12</p>

<p>
It is just time to declare tntnet 1.5.2 stable. The most notable
change is a complete set of man-pages.
</p>

<h2>Release version 1.4.3 of cxxtools</h2>

<p>2006-08-14</p>

<p>
cxxtools::iconvstream is fixed and a new class cxxtools::IConverter,
which simplifies the use of iconv(3) and cxxtools::iconvstream.
</p>

<h2>Development version 1.5.2pre4 of Tntnet</h2>

<p>2006-08-14</p>

<p>
Tntnet has man-pages now.
</p>

<h2>New version 0.6.3 of Tntdb</h2>

<p>2006-07-23</p>

<p>The main reason for this is a license-change. Postgresql is linked against
OpenSSL and the license of tntdb is extended to allow this.
The Sqlite3-driver got some minor fixes.
</p>

<h2>Development version 1.5.2pre3 of Tntnet</h2>

<p>2006-07-09</p>

<p>Tntnet has now thread-scoped variables as a addition to applicatin-
session- and request-scope. Just declare a section &lt;%thread&gt; and
put your variables there. This is useful, e.g. for databaseconnections.
Escpecially for sqlite3, where connections can't be used in other threads,
than the one, who issued sqlite3_open.
</p>

<p>Tntnet handles http-headers and cookies case-insensitive know. It was
a bug, not to do it.</p>

<p>Components aren't deleted any more before the thread ends. Until know
Tntnet had a special cleaner thread, which deleted components,
which aren't used any more. This was not that useful, because components
don't eat much memory and it is really a waste of time to do asyncronous
cleanup without gaining much.</p>

<p>Tntnet has new demos: calcajax and chat shows, how to use ajax with
Tntnet; alldemos shows a (configurable) page with links to all other demos.
</p>

<h2>Release version 1.4.2 of cxxtools</h2>

<p>2006-06-29</p>

<p>Cxxtools is now updated to 1.4.2. Not too much changes here, but
a big step: cxxtools is LGPL now! You can link it with your closed source
or differently licensed software.
</p>

<h2>development version 1.5.2pre2 of Tntnet</h2>

<p>2006-06-12</p>

<p>Since Tntnet is GPL and OpenSSL is not, I decided to port Tntnet to gnutls,
which is LGPL. This version let you choose at configure-time, which ssl-library
to use if any.
</p>

<h2>development version 1.5.2pre1 of Tntnet, version 1.4.2pre1 of cxxtools</h2>

<p>2006-05-31</p>

<p>These are bugfix-releases. Applications based on cxxtools (like Tntnet)
failed to start on systems without IPv6. Some warnings are removed. Tntnet
compiles now with OpenSSL on OpenBSD.</p>

<h2>stable version 1.5.1 of Tntnet, version 1.4.1 of cxxtools</h2>

<p>2006-05-16</p>

<p>The latest development-versions 1.5.1pre4 of Tntnet and 1.4.1pre2 of
cxxtools are released (almost) unchanged.</p>

<h2>development version 1.5.1pre4 of Tntnet, version 1.4.1pre2 of cxxtools</h2>

<p>2006-05-10</p>

<p>This releases adds support for IPv6. You can just pass IPv6-addresses to
socket-classes. License-statements were added in files to make Cxxtools and
Tntnet ready for debian</p>

<h2>development version 1.5.1pre3 of Tntnet, version 1.4.1pre1 of cxxtools and
version 0.6.2 of Tntdb</h2>

<p>2006-04-12</p>

<p>Logging with Cxxtools is optimized. This results in a 30% speed-up. A new
std::ostream-derived class cxxtools::Streamcounter is included, which just counts the
characters, which are printed. The rolling-file-appender uses it to monitor filesize,
which make flushdelay to work with it.
</p>

<p>In Tntdb 0.6.2 the mysql-driver got some bugfixes. Fetching some datatypes (e.g. timestamp)
resulted in a crash, because the Mysql-API returns too small lengths (or I misunderstand
the API;-) ).
</p>

<p>Tntnet extends the license to allow linking with openssl. Some ANSI-C++-violations
are fixed. A new demo newsdb is added, which demonstrates, how to access a database with
Tntdb from a web application. The documentation was reformatted to use only standard fonts,
which reduces the size of the tarball.
</p>

<h2>development version 1.5.1pre2 of Tntnet and new version 0.6.1 of Tntdb</h2>

<p>2006-03-27</p>

<p>
Here is another development-version of Tntnet. This version teaches the
precompiler to generate #line-directives. Error-messages of the c++-compiler
now point directly into to ecpp-source instead of the (intermediate) output of the
precompiler.
</p>

<p>
Tntdb 0.6.1 fixes some minor bugs and makes some small improvements.
The postgresql-driver allows now cursors outside transactions. Passing
date-, datetime- and time-classes to statements may be null.
</p>

<h2>development version 1.5.1pre1 of Tntnet</h2>

<p>2006-03-23</p>

<p>
SSL and internationalization didn't work at all in 1.5.0. This release fixes it. An updated quick-start-guide is included. Some unused code has been removed. Building of static libraries is suppressed, because it does not make sense with Tntnet.
</p>

<h2>Tntnet version 1.5.0, cxxtools 1.4.0</h2>

<p>2006-03-04</p>

<p>
 I finally declared Tntnet 1.5.0 and cxxtools 1.4.0 as stable, just because
 they are. Tntnet 1.5.0 is faster than ever and has gone through many
 stability- and speed-tests, which makes it rock-solid and incredibly fast.
</p>

<p>
 Cxxtools got a new logging-feature, which speeds up logging quite
 significantly. The parameter "flushdelay" enables a background-thread,
 which flushes the outputfile asynchronously. The logentries don't trigger
 a flush, so may logentries are written with one system-call.
 This results in a 15% speed-up of Tntnet in simple cases. Without it
 dynamic pages are just as fast as static pages in apache2. With
 delayed flush Tntnet is well ahead of apache2.
</p>

<h2>tntdb version 0.6.0, Tntnet version 1.5.0pre7, cxxtools 1.4.0pre5</h2>

<p>2006-01-25</p>

<p>
  This version adds a driver for sqlite3, a connectionpool, a introductio
  and lots of smaller fixes and improvements.
</p>

<h2>Tntnet version 1.5.0pre6 and cxxtools 1.4.0pre4</h2>

<p>2005-12-14</p>

<p>
  This is a major upgrade for Tntnet. Tntnet now supports end-tags in
  componentcalls. With this it is easier to build components, which wrap some
  html-content.
  Tntnet now supports gzip-encoding.
</p>


<h2>tntdb version 0.5.2</h2>

<p>2005-11-12</p>

<p>
  Make databasedrivers optional at configure-time.
</p>

<h2>Tntnet version 1.5.0pre5 and cxxtools 1.4.0pre3</h2>

<p>2005-11-08</p>

<p>
  Thread-class in cxxtools is now split into DetachedThread and AttachedThread.
  In Tntnet the workers are derived from DetachedThread. This fixes a major
  bug, which could trigger a unnecesery emergency-restart.
</p>

<h2>Tntnet version 1.5.0pre4</h2>

<p>2005-11-04</p>

<p>New health-check - if a thread takes too long for processing (default: 10
   minutes), the thread is considered hanging and Tntnet is restarted
   automatically.
</p>

<h2>tntdb version 0.5.1</h2>

<p>2005-11-01</p>

<p>This version has some minor bugfixes in the mysql-driver (handling
MYSQL_TYPE_LONGLONG is working now).
</p>

<h2>tntdb version 0.5</h2>

<p>2005-10-24</p>

<p>Tntdb is a c++-library for easy access to databases. It supports dynamic
loading of drivers. Currently drivers for postgresql and mysql are available.
</p>

<h2>Tntnet version 1.5.0pre3</h2>

<p>2005-10-18</p>

<ul>
 <li>fixed bug in generation of components with compressed data.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is hopefully the last prerelease before 1.5.0.
</p>

<h2>Tntnet version 1.5.0pre2</h2>

<p>2005-09-26</p>

<h3>changes</h3>

<ul>
 <li>one level of indirection of factory-pointer removed (binary incompatible
     to 1.5.0pre1!).</li>
 <li>detection of cxxtools- and zlib-headers fixed. Missing headers trigger a
     error at configure-time.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tntnet version 1.5.0pre1 and cxxtools 1.4.0pre1</h2>

<p>2005-09-22</p>

<h3>changes</h3>

<p>
Namingconvention: all classnames starting uppercase, methodnames lowercase.
</p>

<h2>Tntnet version 1.4.0 and cxxtools 1.3.1</h2>

<p>2005-06-17</p>

<h3>changes</h3>

<p>
Unsafe html-characters in c++-expressions is escaped before sent to browser.
</p>

<h2>Tntnet version 1.4.0pre3</h2>

<p>2005-06-11</p>

<h3>changes</h3>

<p>
Simplified api for calling subcomponents in c++-mode. Ecpp-compiler ecppc can
now automatically generate dependencies for Makefile (with -M).
</p>

<h2>Tntnet version 1.4.0pre2</h2>

<p>2005-06-01</p>

<h3>changes</h3>

<p>
Removed boost dependency. Tntnet uses now the POSIX.2-regex instead of
boost-regex. This greatly simplifies installation and also reduces
binary-size. Also a memory-leak in 1.4.0pre1 was fixed.
</p>

<p>
There is a users-guide (in open-office-format) and a yet unfinished
configuration-guide.
</p>

<p>
I tested this release successfully with gcc-4.0.1, which greatly improves
performance (about 20% faster compared to 3.3.4).
</p>

<h2>Tntnet version 1.4.0pre1</h2>

<p>2005-05-27</p>

<h3>changes</h3>

<p>
This version adds automatic session-handling through cookies and scoped
variables. Statevariables can be of any (almost) any type.
</p>

<p>
And I'm finally writing documentation. I'm not good in writing and I would
appreciate any help I can help. Please contact me at tommi@Tntnet.org.
</p>

<h2>Tntnet version 1.3.1</h2>

<p>2005-05-18</p>

<h3>changes</h3>

<p>
This is a bugfix-release. There was a probem with
tnt::httprequest::getPeerAddr().
</p>

<h2>Tntnet version 1.3.0</h2>

<p>2005-02-19</p>

<h3>changes</h3>

<p>
Tntnet has a much improved thread-handling. There is a poller-thread, which
waits for activity on idle connections, so there is not one thread per
connection needed. The number of workerthreads are now limited and justified
dynamically between a low- and high-water-mark.
</p>

<p>
The template-language ecpp has a nicer, more html/xml-like call-syntax for
subcomponents.
</p>

<p>
There are more examples to demonstrate the various features of Tntnet/ecpp. See
directory sdk/demos in the distribution.
</p>

<p>
A configurationscript Tntnet-config helps get a ecpp-application in Tntnet up
and running easily.
</p>

<h2>cxxtools version 1.3.0</h2>

<p>2005-02-19</p>

<h3>changes</h3>

<p>
The socket-classes got some improvements. It handles timeout better now.
</p>

<p>
cxxtools-config is a configuration-script, to help compile against cxxtools
(escpecially cxxtools-log) easier. It also has the ability to generate a
suitable configurationfile for the underlying logging-library.
</p>

<h2>log4shell 0.1 - comand-line-interface to log4cxx</h2>

<p>2005-01-01</p>

<p>
log4shell is a quick hack, which enables shell-scripts to log with
log4cxx.
</p>

New version 1.1.1. Now autoconfigurated. Installation with the usual "configure; make; make install".
